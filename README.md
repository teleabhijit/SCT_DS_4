# SCT_DS_4

🚦 Traffic Accident Data Analysis – Task 04

This project is part of my SkillCraft Technology Internship.
In this task, I analyzed traffic accident data to identify patterns related to:

Road conditions 🛣️

Weather 🌧️☀️

Time of day ⏰

The goal was to visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors to better understand accident trends and risk areas.

📊 Key Steps in Analysis

Data Preprocessing

Cleaned missing and inconsistent data.

Handled categorical features (road condition, weather, etc.).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of accidents by time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night).

Impact of road and weather conditions.

Identification of accident-prone areas (hotspots).

Visualization

Heatmaps of accident hotspots.

Bar/line charts for accident frequency.

Comparative plots for weather and time factors.

🚀 Tools & Technologies

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Development

📈 Insights

Peak accident times are often during rush hours.

Poor weather conditions (rain/fog) significantly increase accident frequency.

Certain road types/intersections emerge as hotspots.

🎯 Value of This Project

This analysis helps in:

Understanding accident risk factors.

Supporting traffic safety planning.

Providing insights for policy decisions and public awareness.
